SpreeFree User Weight Limit: 100KG
Vully thunder weight limit: 150KG

Vully thunder lifespan: Unsure of how long. But half-priced parts for life...
See spare parts listed on their site, but no prices!
So... If there are no prices, and you have to call to order them...
How can you tell you are getting "Half priced parts?"
I guess you could order an entire trampoline worth of parts and see it comes
to half the price of a new one.


Spreed free lifespan: 50,000 hours.

Thunder has 1 year warrenty.
SpringFree has 2 year warrenty.

SpringFree fiberglass poles are 35 dollars each to replace.
And there are a lot more of them. Meaning the cost is more distrubuted around the trampoline.

You can extend your warranty to 3 years for $249 on the vuly thunder.

You look tired from losing all of that weight.

1. Get wingman.
2. Wear glasses always, better at spotting out what you like from far away.
   Seen it make a difference.
   Also makes you look different.
